 * Notes and questions:
 * - under what authorization level does this file need to be in in @app.tsx?
 * - can we download tailwindcss as a dependency (pretty please)
 * - Is our task just to implement the one pager from figma, no backend needed?
 * - is this file in the correct folder in the frontend (apps/frontend/src/shared/pages/HomePage.tsx)
